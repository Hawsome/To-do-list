Imagine you have a little notebook where you can write down all the tasks you need to do. This piece of code is like a digital version of that notebook called a "To-Do List App." It's a special webpage that helps you keep track of your tasks and stay organized.

When you open the webpage, you see a nice layout with a title at the top that says "To-Do List." Underneath, there's a place where you can add your tasks. You can type in a task you want to do, like "Buy groceries," and click a button that looks like a plus sign. This adds the task to your list.

The cool thing is that you can add as many tasks as you want. Each time you enter a new task and click the button, it gets added to the list below. You can see all your tasks in a neat and organized way.

If you complete a task on your list, you can simply delete it.

So, in simple terms, this code creates a webpage that acts as a digital to-do list. You can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. It's like having a handy notebook on your computer or phone to keep track of all the things you need to do.
