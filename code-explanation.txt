HTML CODE: 

This code is an HTML document that creates the structure of a web page for a To-Do List App. Here is what each part of the code does:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares that this is an HTML5 document.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of the document and contains all other elements.
- The `<head>` element contains metadata about the document, such as the document title, external stylesheets, and scripts.
- The `<title>` element specifies the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser's title bar.
- The first `<link>` element includes a CSS stylesheet called `style.css` for styling the page.
- The second `<link>` element includes a font stylesheet from Google Fonts to import the Roboto font family.
- The `<script>` element includes a JavaScript library called Font Awesome to display the plus icon used in the Add button.
- The `<meta>` element provides metadata about the document, such as the viewport size.
- The `<body>` element contains the visible content of the document, including the To-Do List App.
- The `<div>` element with the class `container` groups together the main content of the page.
- The `<h1>` element displays the heading "To-Do List".
- The `<form>` element with the id `todo-form` contains an input field for adding tasks and a button for submitting the form.
- The `<input>` element specifies a text input field for the user to enter tasks.
- The `<button>` element with the type `submit` submits the form when clicked and includes a Font Awesome icon of a plus sign.
- The `<ul>` element with the id `todo-list` will contain the list of tasks added by the user.
- The final `<script>` element links to a JavaScript file called `app.js` which contains the functionality for the To-Do List App.

CSS CODE:

This code is CSS code for styling a to-do list web application. 

The `.container` class sets a maximum width of 400px, centers it on the page, and adds some padding, border radius, and a box-shadow. It also sets the font-family to 'Montserrat', sans-serif.

The `h1` element is styled with a font size of 48px, margin-bottom of 20px, and a color of #333. It also has a text shadow of 2px 2px #f4f4f4.

The `form` element is set to display as a flexbox with a margin-bottom of 20px, justify-content of space-between, and align-items of center.

The `input[type="text"]` element is set to grow and shrink as needed by setting `flex: 1`, has a padding of 10px, font size of 16px, border radius of 5px, and a box-shadow. 

The `button[type="submit"]` element is styled with a padding of 12px, background color of #0077cc, and a white font color. It also has a font size of 18px, border radius of 5px, a box-shadow, and a transition for the background color when hovered over.

The `ul` element is set to not display bullet points, have no padding, a maximum height of 300px, and have a scroll bar if necessary.

The `li` element is set to display as a flexbox, justify-content of space-between, align-items of center, have a background color of #f4f4f4, padding of 10px, a margin-bottom of 10px, and a border-radius of 5px. It also has a box-shadow and a transition for when it is hovered over.

The `.delete` and `.edit` classes style the corresponding buttons with padding, background color, font color, font size, border radius, cursor, and a box-shadow. They also have a hover state that changes the background color.

The `.edit-input` class styles an input field used when editing an item in the to-do list.

There are two media queries included in this code. The first is for screens with a maximum width of 360px, and the second is for screens with a maximum width of 600px. These media queries adjust the styling of the application for smaller screens.

JAVASCRIPT CODE: 

This code is an implementation of a simple to-do list app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a form with an input field where the user can enter a new task, and a list where the tasks are displayed. The app allows the user to add new tasks, delete existing tasks, and edit the content of the tasks. The app also saves the tasks to local storage so that they can be retrieved even if the page is closed and reopened.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- `const form = document.getElementById('todo-form');` - This line selects the form element with the ID "todo-form".
- `const input = form.querySelector('input');` - This line selects the input element inside the form.
- `const ul = document.getElementById('todo-list');` - This line selects the unordered list element with the ID "todo-list".
- `let tasks = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('tasks')) || [];` - This line retrieves the tasks from local storage and parses them from JSON format into an array. If there are no tasks in local storage, it sets the tasks array to an empty array.
- `function loadTasks() {...}` - This is a function that loads the tasks into the DOM when the page is loaded.
- `function saveTasks() {...}` - This is a function that saves the tasks to local storage.
- `function createTaskElement(task) {...}` - This is a function that creates a new task element in the DOM.
- `form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {...}` - This is an event listener that listens for the form submission event and adds a new task to the list.
- `ul.addEventListener('click', function(e) {...}` - This is an event listener that listens for a click event on the list and deletes a task if the user clicks the delete button.
- `ul.addEventListener('click', function(e) {...}` - This is an event listener that listens for a click event on the list and allows the user to edit the task content if they click the edit button.
- `ul.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {...}` - This is an event listener that listens for a keydown event on the list and saves the edited task content if the user presses the Enter key.
- `loadTasks();` - This line calls the `loadTasks()` function when the page is loaded to load any existing tasks from local storage.
- `const toggleModeButton = document.getElementById('toggle-mode');` - This line selects the button element with the ID "toggle-mode".
- `const body = document.body;` - This line selects the body element of the HTML document.
- `toggleModeButton.addEventListener('click', function() {...}` - This is an event listener that listens for a click event on the toggle mode button and toggles between light and dark mode for the app.

Overall, this code creates a basic to-do list app that allows the user to add, edit, and delete tasks, and saves the tasks to local storage for persistence.
